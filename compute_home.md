# Compute Home online VCE

The Compute Home online hosted VCE is provides the simplest way of accessing a module's VCE. No local software installation is required other than a modern web browser, although you will need an internet connection  to access the service. In principle, you should be able to access the online VCE using a smartphone or tablet device as well as a laptop or desktop computer. However, you may find the screen size and on-screen keyboard a limiting factor on usability when using mobile devices. We recommend the use of the Chrome web browser for using the Compute Home online VCE.

A link to the online Compute Home service will be typically be found on the module website in the *Resources* section, often under the heading *Computing Resources*. For modules where the VCE is only required in particular study block, the *Computing Resources* may appear in a particular block resources section. Click the *Compute Home* link to get started. You should see an entry for your particular module. For example, {numref}`your_compute_home_page` shows a VCE launcher link for the October 2021 presentation of the TM129 module. Click the *Start* button to launch the environment.

Your Compute Home page. The presentation code will reflect the presentation you are enrolled on

You may have to wait for several minutes while the environment is set up for you, during which you will see a series of messages such as that shown below. On subsequent visits, access will be quicker.

Waiting while the VCE is set up

When the VCE is fully initialised, you will see the contents page for the Jupyter notebook environment as shown in {numref}`jupyter_classic_nb_home`.

The Jupyter notebook contents page

The exact contents of this page depends on the module. For example, {numref}`example_classic_nb_listing`) shows the initial contents page for the module TM129. Click on a folder to see the file contents within it. Notebooks are self-contained and should be worked through in order. You will be directed to appropriate notebooks from the study planner or module materials as you work your way through the module.

Notebook directory listing organised by study week

A screenshot of a classic Jupyter notebook home page file listing show directories in the content/ directory path. Multiple directories are listed in alphanumeric order. The directory names indicate the study week number and the general topic of study for that week. For example, "04. Not quite intelligent robots".

```

Many VCEs will include a `READ_ME_FIRST.ipynb` notebook in the `content/` folder that can be used test the VCE installation.

To leave the VCE, click the *Logout* link towards the top right-hand corner of the page. This will shut down the VCE, saving your work before it does so.

You will also be logged out after a period of inactivity.

When you return to the VCE and reopen a notebook, you will find your work saved from your previous sessions.

At the end of each block, or whenever you have submitted notebook related assessement material, we **strongly** recommend that you download a copy of the completed Jupyter notebooks. On completion of the module, you may lose access to the hosted VCE and your hosted work files. To keep access to any changes you have made to your notebooks, you will need to download copies of them to your own computer.
