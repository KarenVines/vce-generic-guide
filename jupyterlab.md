# JupyterLab

JupyterLab provides an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides access to a file broiwser and a wide range of file editors, including a fully featured Jupyter notebook editor.

The JupyterLab environment distributed as part of the VCE includes several preinstalled JupyterLab extensions to improve the usability of the environment and support your studies.

The JupyterLab extensions that have been preinstalled into the VCE may differ from module to module.

Some modules may distribute a "JupyterLab configuration pack" as a separately installable Python package. Such packages can be used to extend your own JupyterLab environment outside of the VCE in a way that matches the customisation of the environment within the VCE.

For example, the Jupyterlab environment in the TM351 VCE is extended using the Python package [`ou-tm351-jl-extensions`](https://pypi.org/project/ou-tm351-jl-extensions/).
